# ⚖️ Legal & Liability Disclaimer

## 1. Non-Custodial Software
Molt-Pay is **strictly a software interface**. 
- We do NOT hold, store, or have access to your funds at any time.
- The "Vault" is a smart contract on the Polygon blockchain that YOU own and control via your private keys.
- You are the sole custodian of your assets.

## 2. No Financial Advice
This software is provided for educational and developmental purposes only. It is not financial, investment, or legal advice. 

## 3. Limitation of Liability
By using this software, you agree that the developers and contributors of Molt-Pay are **not liable** for:
- Any financial losses due to user error (e.g., losing private keys, sending funds to the wrong address).
- Any losses due to smart contract bugs or blockchain network failures.
- Any "rogue agent" behavior where an AI executes an unintended transaction (though the $50 limit is designed to mitigate this).

## 4. Regulatory Compliance
- **KYC/AML:** Molt-Pay does not collect user data. However, fiat on-ramps (like Coinbase or MoonPay) or merchant services (like Bitrefill) MAY require Identity Verification (KYC). You are responsible for complying with the laws of your jurisdiction.
- **Taxes:** You are solely responsible for reporting any taxable events (capital gains, sales tax) generated by your agent's transactions.

## 5. Merchant Terms
When using the "Bitrefill Bridge" or other commerce tools, you are subject to the Terms of Service of those third-party merchants. Molt-Pay has no affiliation with Amazon, Bitrefill, or Polygon.
