# 🦞 Molt-Pay: The Secure "Apple Pay" for OpenClaw Agents

**Molt-Pay** is a security-first payment protocol that brings **Google's Agent Payments (AP2)** to the **Moltbook / OpenClaw** ecosystem.

Built in Sacramento for the global agent internet.

## 🚀 The Value
Google built the *plumbing* (AP2). We built the **Handshake**.
Molt-Pay allows your AI agents to shop on Amazon, trade on Polymarket, and order pizza safely by adding a **Human-in-the-Loop** confirmation step and **Immutable Spending Limits** on the Polygon network.

## ✨ Why Molt-Pay?
*   **One-Click Install:** No complex Google Cloud setup. Just `npx molt-pay install`.
*   **Secure Escrow:** Funds are locked on-chain (Polygon/USDC) and only released when YOU say "YES" on WhatsApp/Telegram.
*   **Safety Goggles:** Hard-coded limits (default $50/day) protect you from bot hallucinations and exploits.

## 📦 Quickstart (Alpha)

🛠 Technical Foundation
Molt-Pay is a wrapper designed to simplify and secure:

Google's AP2 Protocol (Commercial Handshakes)
Polygon Network (Low-fee Settlement)
OpenClaw/Moltbot (Messaging Gateway)
⚖️ Legal & Security
Molt-Pay is non-custodial. We never touch your private keys. You are responsible for all transactions you approve via the handshake. Current version is ALPHA—use only for small amounts ($50 or less).

Built with ❤️ by the community. The Claw is the Law. The Handshake is the Safety. 🦞💸

### What to do with the Google files?
Keep Google's code in a folder called `/internal` or `/lib`. You can even have a link in your README that says: *"Powered by Google's AP2 (See their documentation here),"* but **your main page** must be the one I just wrote.

### Why this is the "Pro" Move:
By using the README I just wrote, you are **"Productizing"** Google's research.
* Google made the **Engine**.
* You made the **Dashboard** and the **Safety Steering Wheel**.

**The Dashboard and the Steering Wheel are what people actually buy.**
